# E-commerce-sapatilhas
Hello, I'm developing a sneaker e-commerce site, with the integration of a chatbot for customer help and recommendations in order to improve my knowledge of Asp.net and Azure. I'm using tools like azure Sql database, OpenAi Api and azure app service to host the site.

The home page will have chatbot integration in the future, right now it's simple.

Register <br>

This is the registration page, to create the account that is linked to a database (Azure SQL Database), in which I used asp Identity to create the user, which means that the password is encrypted. 

Login <br>

The login page, all done with asp Identity

Admin Page <br>

The site administrator can manage users, manage products, manage orders and returns. When the admin presses the button to add a product, a pop-up window appears.

Add product <br>

The modal box for adding the product also has one for the other functionalities, and basically adding, removing and editing products will all be based on modal pop ups, the look of the final modal won't be like this, this is just a prototype 

User Page <br>

This is the user's page, where they can change their details, such as contact details, address and password. 

Home page with user logged <br>

When the user is logged in, the top right corner shows the username they have chosen, the users have unique names, no one has the same username, when the chatbot is integrated only people who have logged in can have a conversation with it

This is just a small demonstration of what I've already been doing in my sneaker e-commerce web application, it still has a lot of errors but it's still in development ...
